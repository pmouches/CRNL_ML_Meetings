# CRNL Machine Learning Meetings

These meetings gather all level researchers who are either using, plan to use, or are just interested in machine learning. We meet every two weeks on Wednesday mornings at 10:30am in the Neurocampus. During the meetings, someone usually gives a 30-40 minutes presentation about their work, a future project they would like to conduct, or a machine learning topic or journal paper. Presentations are followed by a discussion. The aim of these meetings are to: 
<ul>
  <li> Provide feedback about ongoing or future ML projects </li>
  <li> Brainstorm on ML projects </li>
  <li> Share knowledge and best practices </li>
  <li> Share tools and methods </li>
</ul>

**Researchers with all levels in machine learning are welcome.**
